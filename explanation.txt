**Exercise 4 – Blind SQL Injection**

The attack exploits a boolean-based blind SQL injection vulnerability in the web application's order status page.
By carefully crafted SQL injection payloads, the script systematically extracts the password for a specific user ID
through a binary search approach. The attack works by sending strategic SQL queries that manipulate the application's
response, allowing the extraction of password characters bit by bit.

The script employs two main techniques: first, determining the exact length of the password using binary search, and
then extracting each character's ASCII value through bit-wise queries. By leveraging the application's boolean response
("Your order has been sent!" or not), the script can infer information about the database contents without directly
seeing the data, ultimately reconstructing the complete password for the target user ID.
